    "## Behavior, Difficulty & Grading: What Drives Retention on Lernnavi?\n",
    "This notebook is the entrypoint to the different parts of the project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Learner dropout remains a central challenge in online education platforms. This project analyzes user engagement on Lernnavi, a curriculum-aligned learning platform used in Swiss secondary schools, to understand what factors most influence student retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We investigate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral Profiles — How do user activity patterns affect next-week engagement? \\\n",
    "Grading Bias — Are open-ended responses evaluated fairly? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior Profiling: Aggregated event logs into weekly features, grouped into six dimensions of self-regulated learning.\\\n",
    "Engagement Prediction: Time-aware classification using tree-based models and LSTM.\\\n",
    "Difficulty Modeling: Constructed difficulty features from user response time and task correctness.\\\n",
    "Bias Detection: Compared grading outcomes with semantic similarity-based oracle labels using multilingual SBERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Effort and regularity dominate engagement prediction.\\\n",
    "Difficulty features alone are weak predictors of dropout.\\\n",
    "Misalignments in grading open-input questions suggest areas for improvement in evaluation consistency.\n"
